The program requests the user to input their age by displaying "Enter your age :".
It reads the input age provided by the user using 'cin' and stores it in the variable 'age'.
The program then uses an 'if-else' statement to check if the entered age is greater than or equal to 18.
If the age is 18 or older, the program outputs "you are an adult.".
If the age is less than 18, the program outputs "you are not an adult.".
Finally, the program returns 0, marking the end of its execution.
