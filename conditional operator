1. The C++ program you shared uses the conditional operator to determine the greater number between variables 'a' and 'b'.
2. It assigns the greater value to the variable 'result' by checking if 'a' is less than 'b'. If true, 'b' is assigned to 'result'; otherwise, 'a' is assigned.
3. The program then outputs the result by displaying "The greatest number is" followed by the value stored in the 'result' variable.
4. Finally, the program returns 0, indicating the end of its execution.
