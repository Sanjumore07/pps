The program uses the binary AND operator '&' to perform a bitwise AND operation between 'a' and 'b'.
It then uses the binary OR operator '|' to perform a bitwise OR operation between 'a' and 'b'.
Next, the program employs the binary XOR operator '^' to perform a bitwise XOR operation between 'a' and 'b'.
It also showcases the Left Shift '<<' and Right Shift '>>' operators, which shift the bits of 'a' by 1 position to the left and right, respectively.
Finally, the program utilizes the One's Complement operator '~' to perform a bitwise negation on 'a'.
