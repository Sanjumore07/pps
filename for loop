The C++ program you provided demonstrates the use of a for loop.
It initializes a variable 'i' to 1 and iterates through the loop as long as 'i' is less than or equal to 5.
Within the loop, it prints the value of 'i' followed by a space.
After printing numbers 1 to 5, it ends the line by using 'cout << endl;'.
Finally, the program returns 0, marking the end of its execution.
