The program uses the equal to operator '==' to check if 'a' is equal to 'b'.
It then uses the greater than operator '>' to determine if 'a' is greater than 'b'.
Next, the program employs the greater than or equal to operator '>=' to check if 'a' is greater than or equal to 'b'.
I also showcases the lesser than operator '<' to verify if 'a' is less than 'b'.
Furthermore, the program uses the lesser than or equal to operator '<=' to ascertain if 'a' is less than or equal to 'b'.
