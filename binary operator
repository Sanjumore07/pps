It initializes two variables, `a` with a value of 8 and `b` with a value of 3.
The program then performs the following operations:
Addition: `a + b` and prints the result.
Subtraction: `a - b` and prints the result.
 Multiplication: `a * b` and prints the result.
 Division: `a / b` and prints the result.
 Modulo: `a % b` (remainder of `a` divided by `b`) and prints the result.
