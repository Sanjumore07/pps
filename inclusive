The C++ program prompts the user to enter a number.
It reads the input number and stores it in the variable 'num'.
The program checks if the entered number is between 10 and 20 (inclusive) using the logical AND operator (&&).
If the condition (num >= 10 && num <= 20) is met, it outputs that the number is between 10 and 20.
If the number does not satisfy the condition, the program outputs that the number is not between 10 and 20.
Finally, the program ends after displaying the result.
