The program includes the iostream library for input and output operations.
The main function is defined, where an integer variable 'number' is declared.
The program then asks the user to enter an integer.
The user's input is stored in the 'number' variable using cin.
Finally, the program prints out "You entered" followed by the integer that the user input.
